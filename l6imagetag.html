<!-- 
There are 2 ways to add image in HTML.
1. Internal Image
2. External Image

External Images are image which will load or show when there is internet, otherwise it will not load/show to us.

In the image attribute, we've 'alt' attribute which will tells us what image we use if image doesn't load up properly.
